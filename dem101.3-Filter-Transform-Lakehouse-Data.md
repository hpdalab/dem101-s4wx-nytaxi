# dem101.3 Filter & Transoform Lakehouse Data


## Reference and Note
1. This 3rd module of the workflow will showcase basic ETL-like capabilities within Lakehouse -- using Presto engine to filter and transform data
2. As the original dataset has 110M rows, we'll trim it down to a workable 5M-row dataset here
3. All the SQL query scripts are stored in a the same worksheet called "bkt001_nyctaxi". We can comment in and out blocks of scripts during runtime.
4. 

## Filter First 5M Rows of Data into a New Table


#### Run 2nd SQL Query to Extract 5M Rows into New ORC-based Table

SQL query to extract first 5M rows from "bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_csv" and convert into a new ORC-based table "bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M"

```
create table bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M
WITH (
  format = 'orc'
)
as 
select * from bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_csv LIMIT 5000000
```

#### Verify ORC-based file is created on Object Storage

SQL query to convert table "bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M" into "bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M_orc" with all values formatted to the correst data types 


```
CREATE TABLE bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M_orc
COMMENT '2018 Newyork City taxi data 5M row'
WITH (FORMAT = 'ORC')
AS
SELECT 
    cast(vendorid as INTEGER) as vendorid,
    date_parse(timepickup, '%m/%d/%Y %h:%i:%s %p') as timepickup,
    date_parse(timedropoff, '%m/%d/%Y %h:%i:%s %p') as timedropoff,
    cast(passengercount as SMALLINT) as passengercount,
    cast(tripdistance as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as tripdistance,
    cast(ratecodeid as INTEGER) as ratecodeid,
    cast(storefwdflag as CHAR(1)) as storefwdflag,
    cast(pulocationid as INTEGER) as pulocationid,
    cast(dolocationid as INTEGER) as dolocationid,
    cast(paymenttype as SMALLINT) as paymenttype,
    cast(fare as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as fare,
    cast(extra as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as extra,
    cast(mtatax as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as mtatax,
    cast(tip as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as tip,
    cast(tolls as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as tolls,
    cast(surcharge as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as surcharge,
    cast(total as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as total
FROM bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M
```


#### Run SQL Query to Test Finalized Table

```
select * from bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M_orc where fare > 400
```
Note: We are looking for trips with fares more than $400 and found some shockingly high ones (likely due to data entry errors as all three were from the same time)
