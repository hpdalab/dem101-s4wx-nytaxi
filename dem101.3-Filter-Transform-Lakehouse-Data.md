SQL query to extract first 5M rows from "bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_csv" and convert into a new ORC-based table "bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M"

```
create table bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M
WITH (
  format = 'orc'
)
as 
select * from bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_csv LIMIT 5000000
```

SQL query to convert table "bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M" into "bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M_orc" with all values formatted to the correst data types 


```
CREATE TABLE bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M_orc
COMMENT '2018 Newyork City taxi data 5M row'
WITH (FORMAT = 'ORC')
AS
SELECT 
    cast(vendorid as INTEGER) as vendorid,
    date_parse(timepickup, '%m/%d/%Y %h:%i:%s %p') as timepickup,
    date_parse(timedropoff, '%m/%d/%Y %h:%i:%s %p') as timedropoff,
    cast(passengercount as SMALLINT) as passengercount,
    cast(tripdistance as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as tripdistance,
    cast(ratecodeid as INTEGER) as ratecodeid,
    cast(storefwdflag as CHAR(1)) as storefwdflag,
    cast(pulocationid as INTEGER) as pulocationid,
    cast(dolocationid as INTEGER) as dolocationid,
    cast(paymenttype as SMALLINT) as paymenttype,
    cast(fare as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as fare,
    cast(extra as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as extra,
    cast(mtatax as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as mtatax,
    cast(tip as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as tip,
    cast(tolls as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as tolls,
    cast(surcharge as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as surcharge,
    cast(total as DECIMAL(8, 2)) as total
FROM bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M
```

```
select * from bkt001c1.bkt001_nyctaxi.bkt001_nyctaxi_5M_orc where fare > 400
```
Note: We are looking for trips with fares more than $400 and found some shockingly high ones (likely due to data entry errors as all three were from the same time)
